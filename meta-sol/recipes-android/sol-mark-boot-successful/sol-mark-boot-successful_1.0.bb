SUMMARY = "Mark the A/B boot slot successful so the bootloader keeps booting it"
DESCRIPTION = "sol's bootloader decrements the slot's tries-remaining on every \
boot and expects userspace to mark the slot successful. Nothing did, so the \
counter reached zero and the bootloader declared the slot unbootable and \
dropped to fastboot, needing a host to recover. AOSP marks the slot from \
update_verifier on sys.boot_completed, a property AsteroidOS never sets, so the \
binary shipped in the container image but never ran."
